
/**
* This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
* "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
*
* This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
* A command currently consists of two strings: a command word and a second
* word (for example, if the command was "take map", then the two strings
* obviously are "take" and "map").
* 
* The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
* command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
* known) then the command word is <null>.
*
* If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
*
