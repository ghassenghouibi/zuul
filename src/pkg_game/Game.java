/**
*  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
*  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
*  can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended 
*  to make it more interesting!
* 
*  To play this game, create an instance of this class.
* 
*  This main class creates the necessary implementation objects and starts the game off.
